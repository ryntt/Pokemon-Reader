# Pokemon-Reader
This is a program designed to read a spreadsheet (pokemon.csv) of Pokemon characteristics and filter and sort Pokemon based on specific criteria. 
It also uses JUnit/Hamcrest to implement test methods to ensure the program works correctly. 
## Instructions for Running the Program
NOTE: JUnit and Hamcrest must be installed in order for the program to run correctly. The program works with JUnit 4.13.2 and Hamcrest 2.2. 
- To list all the Pokemon and characteristics, run the main method in Pokemon.java
- To run the JUnit test methods, run the main method in PokemonTestRunner.java. Note that three of the methods (negativeTestHPList, negativeTestLetterList, and negativeTestLegendaryCount) are supposed to fail, so there should be 3 errors noted in the output.
